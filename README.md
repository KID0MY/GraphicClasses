### Class #1
We learned how to create our first shader. its is a simple unlit shader where we can control the color of it.

### Independent Studies 1
i am trying to learn by myself how to do a gradient shader and understand how it works.

### Independent Studies 2
I just learned about Shader Buffers or best known as Stencil Shaders and oh lord its a bit scary but i think i got a shader going!
personally will probably used it to mkae holograms in my game. simple but probably effective!
